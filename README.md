# Embodied-Moxie
Moxie is an AI robot targeting 5 to 10-year-old children for Social Emotional Learning. It offers activities like Daily Missions for making friends, expressive dancing, and therapeutic breathing exercises. I was instrumental in designing these activities and crafting supporting tools for them, using Python, Jinja2, and Chatscript. 

The files in this repository of some of my best work showcasing my contribution to empowering the tools my fellow designers can utilize to create unique experiences for Moxie and the kids. On top of each file is a README.

To get started, listed below are some of the activities I created from initial concept to finalization along with a link to the best file to look at first:
